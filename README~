WELCOME
=======

Part of the SAETTA project.
(read a bit about saetta here http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~dirocco/saetta.html )

BACKGROUND
==========

SaettaNG is intended to give the Saetta platform some new spice.
Given the fact that the platform is branching into two very different variations and
that the ultimate objective is run the experiment under ROS, some heavy
modifications are needed.
This project attempts to solve most of the problems in this regard.


CURRENT STATUS
==============

The project actually builds, but does nothing useful.
The current state is that a client can receive a server's updates in a decentralized
manner and without any previous knowledge of IPs or network layout.
Server and client cannot operate on the same machine (due to how the MULTICAST
implementation works).
Both programs default to connect through eth0, but using the flag -i iface it's
possible to have them use another interface.
It's been tested both on ethernet and wifi networks and so far this part seems
pretty solid.
